<h1> Hex Conversion </h1>

First I converted my name to lowercase entirely and found the corresponding ASCII characters. 
These were 115, 97, 114, 97.

I divided each of these by 16 to get a quotient and a remainder. The quotient I put as the first digit and the remainder as the second. 
For example, for 115, when I divided it by 16 I got a quotient of 7 and a remainder of 3. 
The resulting number was 73.

All of the ASCII numbers converted to hex in order were 73 61 72 61.
Therefore, my name encrypted became 73617261.

<h1> Binary Conversion </h1>

To convert 2008 to binary I kept dividing by 2 and adding the remainder as a digit earlier.

For example, the first time I divided by 2, I got 0 so the last digit was a 0. I was left with 1004.

I continued this until I had 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0.
So my answer was 11111011000.
